      <h1>Layered Realities</h1>
      <p>Layered Realities is an interactive multimedia art installation based on the viral RGB paintings, inviting the visitor to explore three hidden visual layers through the activation of an RGB flashlight. The project brings together the thematic concepts of humanity, technology, and nature in the concepts of color theory: green light to unveil the human level in magenta, blue light to reveal the technological in yellow, and red light to unveil nature in cyan. The viewer engages with the artwork by modifying the color of the flashlight, which changes their experience with a simple click of the button.</p>
      <p>Humanity is represented via laser-cut prints of two hands, symbolizing interaction and togetherness. Tech is represented via Cricut-cut yellow-colored vinyl stickers set to create a pattern mimicking a circuit board, meaning digital infrastructure and connections. Nature is represented via blue-colored, 3D-printed tendrils, blending natural elements with man-made materials.</p>
      <p>By integrating digital fabrication techniques with conventional aesthetic sensibilities, Layered Realities creates an interactive space for active audience engagement. The installation encourages viewers to consider the manner in which stacked meanings—human, technological, and natural—collaborate with modern life. Apart from aesthetic engagement, the artwork incites discussions on the manner in which technology intervenes in our comprehension of the world and how it revises the boundaries between the material and the digital.</p>

      <h1>Arduino-Based Security Alarm System</h1>
      <p>Security Alarm System is an inexpensive, Arduino-based interactive device aimed at enhancing residential security with simple but effective electronics. Spurred by a personal interest in cybersecurity and a need for an affordable home security component, the system utilizes an infrared (IR) sensor to detect movement, temperature changes, or infrared radiation reflection towards an entry point. When it senses movement, the Arduino translates the HIGH output signal from the sensor into an action, causing a piezo buzzer to produce an oscillating "beep" sound to alert the user in real time.</p>
      <p>The project is instant response-based, and the design ensures an engaging user-machine interaction. IR sensor is taken as input, and buzzer as output. Cardboard is employed for housing in the shape of a small building with a functional door to simulate practical use. The Arduino board is placed inside the building to maintain the setup portable and lightweight.
</p>
      <p>In development, problems such as the buzzer having only a single-pitched tone were solved by programming alternating analogWrite() with delays to produce a more imperative alarm tone. By the unification of inexpensive components, simple assembly, and low expense, the project demonstrates how efficient security can be rapidly prototyped. The result is both a functional alarm system and a teaching example of interactive electronics in home protection.</p>
